    <h1>Robotics</h1>
    <p>Starting in middle school, I began to further apply my love of logic and math in other, more experimental endeavors. I joined my robotics team in 8th grade, the earliest I could in my school post-quarantine, and we participated in the First Tech Challenge competition, an international competition for middle and high schoolers run by FIRST, a nonprofit that also has two other divisions of competition for different scales of robots and age groups.</p>
